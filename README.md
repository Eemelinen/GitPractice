**This is a practice project where I tested different functionalities of Git and Github.**

**Things tested so far:**

- Added stuff to README.
- I add a line to README.
- Third line introduced
- Adding branch updates.
- I hope this wont break things.
- New stashing modification

- I did reset soft reset to previous commit.

- I did a hard reset to back to later commit using reflog.

- Adding and removing branches both locally and in Github.

- Tested pull --all command locally.
- Tested pull with --rebase locally

- Development branch set as default branch.
